          <div class="two-columns__main-text">
            <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Whether it's at school or university, the one thing no one ever teaches
              you is how to teach yourself. We
              often just end up drilling specific exercises and mindlessly memorizing information so that when exam time
              comes around, we pass the test. But once the test is over, that information has outlived its usefulness,
              and
              there's no guarantee that information will be retained. In the end, we're really just learning how to pass
              our tests.</p>
            <p class="two-columns__paragraph"><span class="two-columns__span-accent">Here's the real question:</span>
              does this approach of repetition
              and memorization help us truly understand the subject material? The academic consensus nowadays is that it
              doesn't. In fact, what's more important than any individual topic is knowing how to study, but for some
              reason, this point is often overlooked. So, what can we do to remedy this? </p>
            <p class="two-columns__paragraph">Well, there are various techniques and exercises that can be applied to
              the educational process to help
              make it more efficient and engaging. Keep scrolling to uncover some of the secrets of effective learning.

          </h2>

          <div class="two-columns__main-text">
            <p class="two-columns__paragraph"> Math didn't come naturally to Barbara in childhood. She thought of
              herself as more of a humanities
              person,
              and not a brilliant one at that. With an eye to becoming a linguist, after school she enlisted in the
              army,
              who sent her to learn Russian. After several years of service, during which she rose to the rank of
              Captain,
              Barbara left the army and decided to study engineering. In was during this time that she developed her
              learning methodology as she was forced to reprogram her brain for a different kind of learning. It turns
              out
              that when something doesn't come naturally to you, having to work hard to gain the knowledge that other
              people may get at first glance gives you a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
